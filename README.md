# CA-Groundwater-Visualization
The Resources folder of this project(too large to be pushed to Git) contains a cleaned CSV of data merged using python and pandas from the following sources:

California Natural Resources Agency: 
Measurements - Groundwater level time series measurements
(https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dd9b15f5-6d08-4d8c-bace-37dc761a9c08/resource/bfa9f262-24a1-45bd-8dc8-138bc8107266/download/measurements.csv)

Station - Groundwater well location information
https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dd9b15f5-6d08-4d8c-bace-37dc761a9c08/resource/af157380-fb42-4abf-b72a-6f9f98868077/download/stations.csv

Screenrecording of the Visualizations when Resources folder with cleaned CSV, or API hookup, is present: https://youtu.be/KQFxkT1aHGI

Future considerations: 

-Creating a SQL Database from the Measurements and Station databases and using this as the data source.

-Integrating the California Natural Resources API as the data source.
